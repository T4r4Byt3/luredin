🌣 LuredIn: A Corporate Clout Simulator

LuredIn is a desktop satire game that lets you "roleplay" as a painfully earnest thought leader on the world’s most professionally performative platform. Chase likes, craft vacuous inspiration, and bask in the glow of your own echo chamber.

🧠 WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS?!

It’s a parody of social media and influencer culture, disguised as a desktop game.

🌟 Post inspirational content with no real meaning.

📈 Watch your follower count grow as you climb the ranks—from Junior Growth Influencer to G.O.A.T of Strategic Synergy.

😇 Bask in a flood of supportive AI-generated comments… until one of them calls you out. Game over.

💼 Use corporate buzzwords like “moving the needle,” “leveraging core competencies,” and “embracing ambiguity” to become the guru you were always meant to be.
