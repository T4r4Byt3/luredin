🌣 LuredIn: A Corporate Clout Simulator

LuredIn is a desktop satire game that lets you "roleplay" as a painfully earnest thought leader on the world’s most professionally performative platform. Chase likes, craft vacuous inspiration, and bask in the glow of your own echo chamber.

🧠 WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS?!

It’s a parody of social media and influencer culture, disguised as a desktop game.

🌟 Post inspirational content with no real meaning.

📈 Watch your follower count grow as you climb the ranks—from Assofiate Growth Influencerof the Status Quo, to G.O.A.T of Strategic Synergy.

😇 Bask in a flood of supportive AI-generated comments… until one of them calls you out. Game over.

💼 Use corporate buzzwords like “moving the needle,” “leveraging core competencies,” and “embracing ambiguity” to become the guru you were always meant to be.

📀HOW TO PLAY

1. Download the EXE

2. Launch it:No need to install anything else. Just double-click and begin your climb up the influence ladder by creating your new Moniker, and clicking the Synergize Profile button.
3. Entering a text prompt in the box, and click "Synthesiz Post!" button and watch the magic of word salad happen.
4. (Optional) View the number of comments, and followers below your post. Your follower count may increase or decrease, depending on the number of positive or negative comments you receive. There's a "swing" in there, the higher you get, and a nuclear lose condition if one of your "followers" discovers that you've been using AI to bot out your synergytical thought leadership this whole time.
5. You can generate as little or as many posts as you want for your given workday - just like an IRL influencer.
6. You can also end the workday without making any posts, just to see what happens there (you might ose followers, because you're expected to feed the technofeudalistic fiefdom with your vibes).
7. You can choose to read the comments or not.
8. Clicking the "My Work is Done!" button will save your game, and will tally your score for the day, change your title prefixes, etc.
9. Optional – Contribute to the Code:The original Python file is available for contributors or curious minds. Feel free to fork and extend the nonsense. See Contributions section for ideas.
